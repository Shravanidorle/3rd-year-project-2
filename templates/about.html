        <h1>About Our Project</h1>
        <p>This project leverages OpenCV and AI/ML to provide real-time patient monitoring in a hospital setting. Our goal is to enhance patient safety and streamline hospital management by automating the detection of critical events like falls or signs of distress.</p>

        <p>The system is designed to integrate with existing CCTV infrastructure, providing a non-intrusive way to monitor patients while respecting their privacy. Alerts are sent to a central dashboard, allowing hospital staff to respond promptly to emergencies.</p>

            <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
            <p>The system is built on a robust, lightweight stack ideal for real-time processing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Backend:** Python, Flask, and Flask-SocketIO for real-time communication.</li>
                <li>**AI/ML:** TensorFlow and Keras for the trained fall detection model.</li>
                <li>**Video Processing:** OpenCV (cv2) for frame capture and manipulation.</li>
                <li>**Frontend:** HTML5, CSS (Styled), and JavaScript for a responsive dashboard.</li>
            </ul>
